          <p color="white">
            The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is an art museum located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, on 53rd Street
            between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
            It plays a major role in developing and collecting modern art, and is often identified as one of the largest
            and most influential museums of modern art in the world.
            MoMA's collection offers an overview of modern and contemporary art, including works of architecture and
            design, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated books and artist's books, film, and
            electronic media.
            The MoMA Library includes approximately 300,000 books and exhibition catalogs, over 1,000 periodical titles,
            and over 40,000 files of ephemera about individual artists and groups.
            The archives holds primary source material related to the history of modern and contemporary art.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              The Museum of Modern Art seeks to create a dialogue between the established and the experimental, the past
              and the present, in an environment that is responsive to the issues of modern and contemporary art, while
              being accessible to a public that ranges from scholars to young children.
