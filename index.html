            It plays a major role in developing and collecting modern art, and is often identified as one of the largest
            and most influential museums of modern art in the world.

            design, drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, prints, illustrated books and artist's books, film, and
            electronic media.
            The MoMA Library includes approximately 300,000 books and exhibition catalogs, over 1,000 periodical titles,
            and over 40,000 files of ephemera about individual artists and groups.
